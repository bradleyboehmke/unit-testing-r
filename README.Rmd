# Unit Testing in R

## Problem Statement

An important part of writing code is to ensure it functions as expected and, as 
we make updates, the functionality doesn't break. To help minimize these risks 
we should always include unit testing in our code. Moreover, unit testing should 
be incorporated and automated for not only R packages but also individual 
scripts.

## Suggested Solution

TBD

## Available Packages

There are several packages and functions that provide various capabilities in 
the unit testing toolchain. The following provides a synopsis of the most 
commonly used and the sections that follow discuss how and when to implement 
them:

- R CMD check:  
- testthat:
- tinytest:
- lintr:
- mockery:
- covr:

## Directory Layout

The most common approach, whether you are testing an R package, individual 
scripts or a directory of scripts, is to have unit tests separated into their 
own subdirectory from the root of the project directory. For example, if you 
have a set of functions (`my_functions.R`) and a script that does analysis 
(`sample_script.R`) you would include any unit tests in a subdirectory.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(path = ".", recurse = FALSE, 
             regexp = "my_functions.R|sample_script.R|tests")
```

Likewise, when unit testing an R package, we typically isolate tests into their 
own subdirectory as illustrated below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(path = "examplepkg", recurse = FALSE)
```

This is not always necessary. For example, we can embed unit tests directly in 
the source file for the function being tested or in analysis scripts. This may 
have the benefit of aligning tests right next to the functionality being tested; 
however, the above approach is the most common and most organized structure.

## Testing Packages

Most people get exposed to code testing when first developing an R package. An R 
package has very specific structure and documentation requirements so testing is 
essential to ensure your package can be submitted to CRAN or to even make sure 
it will operate correctly when used.

### R CMD check

`R CMD check` is a key component of testing your package. `R CMD check` is 
actually the name of the command you run from the terminal. Historically, when 
building an R package, you would first create the package, convert it to the 
.tar.gz file, run `R CMD check pkgname.tar.gz`, and if everything passes you 
would submit to CRAN.

However, most people do not run it directly in the terminal. Rather they run it 
interactively using `devtools::check()`. In some cases you may need to run 
`R CMD check` programmatically and not in an interactive session. To do so, you 
can use `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck()`. This will capture the results of `R CMD check` 
as an object which can then be queried and investigated. In both cases (
`devtools::check()` and `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck()`), you do not need to build the 
.tar.gz file; rather, you can just run the function on the root of the package 
and it will build the .tar.gz and then run `R CMD check`.

Running `R CMD check` will actually perform over 50 individual checks covering:

- Package metadata (i.e. version number)
- Package structure (i.e. directory layout, size, executable files)
- DESCRIPTION file (i.e. meta-info, package dependencies)
- Namespace (i.e. does it exist, is it parseable)
- R code (i.e. syntax errors, function dependencies)
- Data (i.e. if a data directory exists is it set up properly)
- Documentation (i.e. function documentation, cross-references)
- Compiled code (i.e. existance and functionality of C/C++, Fortran)
- Tests (i.e. each file in a `test/` or `tests/` subdirectory is run)
- Vignettes (i.e. build and check that vignettes run)

For more detailed information on what gets tested in each of these areas see 
section [17.2](https://r-pkgs.org/r-cmd-check.html#check-checks) in the 
[_R Packages_](https://r-pkgs.org/) book.

One thing to note, if you have tests developed in the `tests/` directory of a 
package, then running `R CMD check` will run these tests and run all the other 
checks on the package. However, as you will see shortly, there are other ways 
to run the tests separately from `R CMD check` that provides you more flexibility.

### Unit testing packages with testthat

As previously mentioned, when unit testing an R package, we typically isolate 
unit tests into their own `tests/` subdirectory. The most common way to unit 
test R packages is to use the [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) package. 
When using testthat in a package we set up our `tests/` directory as follows and 
we also need to add testthat as a Suggests in the DESCRIPTION file. You can 
easily set up this structure using `usethis::use_testthat()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(path = "examplepkg/tests", recurse = FALSE)
```

Within the `tests/` directory, you'll see a `testthat.R` file and a `testthat` 
directory. The `testthat.R` file is a file you will rarely edit, but it needs to 
be there because this is what will get run when you run `R CMD check`. You'll 
see one function in this file (`test_check("examplepkg")`), which directs 
`R CMD check` to run all the tests in the `testthat` subdirectory.

If you are running tests interactively (from the console), then you can just run 
`devtools::test()` and it will run and report test results.

So all the unit test magic will be contained in the `tests/testthat/` 
subdirectory. If we look at this subdirectory we see what a typical directory 
layout looks like. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(path = "examplepkg/tests", recurse = TRUE)
```

You'll notice 4 classes of .R files in this directory:

1. Test files start with "test" and are executed in alphabetical order. This is 
   where all your unit tests will reside. How you split up your tests across 
   multiple scripts is up to you.
2. Helper files start with "helper" and are executed before tests are run. If 
   you have special custom functions that are used only during testing then you 
   will want to place them here rather than in the package `R/` directory.
3. Setup files start with "setup" and are executed before tests. If you have 
   certain environment variables, data, or other items that will be used across 
   all your tests then its best to place them here.
4. Teardown files start with "teardown" and are executed after the tests are run. 
   Often, if you are setting up a special environment in a "setup" file then you 
   will likely want to close that environment down after testing.
   
You do not need all these types of files. In fact, in many packages you will 
simply see the "test-xx.R" files. Within a "test-xx.R", we typically have the 
following structure:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/test-structure.png")
```

where

- `context()` defines a set of tests that test related functionality. 
  Usually you will have one context per file, but you may have multiple contexts 
  in a single file if you so choose. This is mainly useful when reporting test 
  results as it allows you to see how many tests are run, and their results, for 
  specific functionality being tested. If you do not include `context()` then 
  the name of the test file will be used as the context.
- `test_that()` encapsulates a series of expectations about small, self-contained 
  set of functionality. Each test is contained in a context and can contain one 
  or multiple expectations.
- `expect_xxx()` are the actual unit tests being run. All expectations begin 
  with `expect_` and you can even create your own 
  [custom expectations](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/custom-expectation.html).
 
We can run these tests multiple ways. Most often we run them with `devtools::test()` 
(assuming you are in the package root directory). We can have the results reported 
in multiple ways. By default it will report detailed results. Note that results 
can be "OK", "F" for failure, "W" for warning, and "S" for skipped.

```r
> devtools::test()
Loading examplepkg
Testing examplepkg
✔ |  OK F W S | Context
✔ |   2       | header()
✔ |   2       | filter()
✔ |   2       | summarize()
✔ |   1       | Require no code style errors [1.0 s]
✖ |   0 1     | Demonstrate a test that fails
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
test-05-demo-failure.R:4: failure: dummy test to signal failure
FALSE isn't true.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

══ Results ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Duration: 1.0 s

OK:       7
Failed:   1
Warnings: 0
Skipped:  0
```

We can also adjust the reporting mechanism to get minimal results reported:

```r
> devtools::test(reporter = "minimal")
Loading examplepkg
Testing examplepkg
.......F
```

Run silently but gather the results to be reported elsewhere:

```r
> devtools::test(reporter = "silent")
```

So other options with `?Reporter`.
   

### Unit testing packages with tinytest

### Package testing workflow

When building an R package, I typically:

1. Set up the structure of the package and then run `R CMD check` to make sure 
the structure is right.
2. As I build a new function or do bug fixes, I run the unit tests first until 
my code changes pass all unit tests and then I run `R CMD check` to ensure no 
other package requirements got overlooked.
